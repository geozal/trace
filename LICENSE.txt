1. AUTHOR & OWNERSHIP  
1.1 This software, including but not limited to its codebase, logic, structure, user interface, features, assets, and documentation, was solely created, is currently owned, and is actively maintained by Georgios Zaltos, who also operates under the pseudonyms “geozal” and “zaltOS” (hereafter referred to as “the Creator”).  
1.2 The Creator is the sole and original author of the software. No individual, group, organization, or external party has contributed to or holds claim to any portion of the source code, assets, designs, branding, or intellectual property unless explicitly credited and licensed by the Creator under a separate written agreement.  
1.3 All rights, title, and intellectual property—including but not limited to source code, executables, logs, exported data, graphical elements, design patterns, documentation, and associated materials—remain the exclusive legal property of the Creator. No part of the software or its derivatives may be used, referenced, or reproduced in whole or in part for any purpose not permitted by this License Agreement.

2. LICENSE SCOPE  
2.1 The Creator grants the end user (“Licensee”) a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to install and use the software under the conditions defined below. This license does not grant ownership, resale rights, or any other rights not explicitly stated.  
 2.1.1 This license permits use of the software strictly for personal, non-commercial, or internal purposes.

 2.1.2 The software may only be installed and used on Microsoft Windows–based systems that are directly owned, leased, or exclusively operated by the Licensee. Use on shared infrastructure, cloud-based systems, virtualized multi-user environments, or machines not under the Licensee's full control is prohibited without prior written agreement.  
 2.1.3 Each license key issued is tied to a single hardware system. The Licensee is entitled to one key per qualifying machine. Additional license keys may be requested for other systems personally or professionally owned by the Licensee, subject to reasonable limits and approval by the Creator. All license keys are subject to usage auditing and may be revoked if used in violation of this agreement.

2.2 Any and all of the following actions are STRICTLY prohibited WITHOUT a formal, signed licensing agreement executed between the Licensee and the Creator:  
 • Redistribution of the software or any part of its code, binaries, assets, or documentation, whether publicly or privately.  
 • Sublicensing, leasing, renting, lending, or granting access to third parties.  
 • Resale or offering the software as part of any paid or unpaid service, product, or package.  
 • Hosting the software on public platforms, websites, mirrors, repositories, or cloud services.  
 • Uploading or sharing the software through forums, file-sharing services, or peer-to-peer networks.  
 • Reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, translating, unpacking, debugging, or otherwise attempting to analyze, access, reconstruct, or derive the source code, internal logic, file structure, data schemas, algorithms, or any technical implementation of the software in whole or in part—regardless of intent, method, or tool used.  
 • Creating derivative works based on the software or repurposing components in other tools or systems.  
 • Integrating or embedding the software into commercial, governmental, educational, or institutional environments without explicit authorization.
